This is the source code for our paper published in ICIP2018 entitled "3D Steganalysis Using the Extended Local Feature Set".

The code can extract 48-dim features which are proposed by the paper above. 
Combining them with LFS76 feature set, you can get the ELFS124 feature set.  

Please cite our paper if you use this code in your work. 
The bibtex is as follows.
